Do you remember the game of hop?

Get a  number between 2 and 6 from the user(you can use prompt and alert in this practice), then log from 1 to 200 in the console.
It is just like the game of hop, whatever number the user enters, the numbers will be printed accordingly.

Example: If the user enters the number 3, the numbers will be printed like this:
1, 2, hop, 4, 5, hop, 7, 8, hop, 10 ..., 200

//! Answer:
let saveValue = prompt("Please enter a nubmer between 2-6 ðŸ¤«(check the console)");
for (let index = 1; index < 201; index++) {
  if (saveValue > 2 && saveValue < 6) {
    if (index % saveValue === 0) {
      console.log("hop");
    } else {
      console.log([index]);
    }
  } else {
    alert("between 2-6 honey !ðŸ¤“");
  }
}
